<h1>LifeLogger API</h1>
<p>
    This Swagger API describes a website called LifeLogger. With LifeLogger, you can create an account, use JWT
    authentication, describe habits, and track vitals like weight and other bodily stats. Users can subscribe to
    habits to monitor personal achievements.
</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    Click on each section to expand it and see it's description and documentation.
</p>
<details>
    <summary>Create an Account</summary>
    <p>
        To get started, use the <a href="#operations-Users-create-users">/user/create</a> endpoint to create a
        new account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've created your account and authenticated with the server (basic or JWT on the swagger, JWT only
        from a frontend); You may begin accessing the features, like subscribing to a habit, or tracking your vitals
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Authentication</summary>
    <p>
        This section describes how to authenticate with the LifeLogger API using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
        <br><br>
        To learn more about JWT, visit <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction">https://jwt.io/introduction</a>
        <br>
        This website uses <a href="https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Simple_JWT</a>
        to implement JWT authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>To authenticate with the LifeLogger API</b>, you'll need to obtain a JWT from the server by sending a POST
        request to the <a href="#operations-Authentication-auth-token-create">/auth/token/</a> endpoint
        with your username and password in the request body. The server will respond with a JWT, which you can use
        to make authenticated requests to the API.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make an authenticated request to the API, include the JWT in the header property <code>Authorization
    </code> in your HTTP request using the following format:
    </p>
    <code>"Authorization": "Bearer &lt;JWT access token&gt;"</code>
    <p>
        Use the <a href="#operations-Authentication-auth-token-refresh">/auth/token/refresh/</a> endpoint and the
        <code>refresh</code> token generated from the <code>auth/token/</code> endpoint (above) to get a new
        <code>access</code> token.
    </p>

    <summary>Habits</summary>
    <p>
        This section is about tracking habits. A user can "subscribe"
        to a habit that they want to work on. Subscribing to a habit that doesn't exist yet will automatically create
        it and associate it with the user.
        <br>
        There are no limitations or grouping (treating upper and lowercase habits as the same habit) yet. There may
        also be a NSFW filter using a word set and a machine learning algorithm to try and keep the habits clean-ish.
        <br>
        <br>
        Habits can be good or bad, with the assumption that users want to work towards good habits, and work on
        stopping bad habits.
        <br>
        <br>
        Habits are tracked using the <a href="#operations-Subscribed_Habits-add-subscribed-habits">/habits/subscribe/</a> and
        <a href="#operations-Subscribed_Habits-remove-subscribed-habits">/habits/unsubscribe/</a> endpoints.
        <br>
        Once a habit is subscribed to, the user can update each habit daily to help show progress (which may
        eventually be displayed on a graph or timeline).
        <br>
        <br>
        Each time a user updates one of their subscribed habits, a habit history log (<a
            href="#operations-Habit_History_Log-list-habit-history-log">/habits/history
        /logs/list/</a> is generated. This
        endpoint can be used to generate graphs per user or per habit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Use the <a href="#operations-Subscribed_Habits-modify-subscribed-habits">/habits/subscribed/update/</a>
        endpoint to update their progress on a given habit. The habits the user is subscribed to can be found using
        the <a href="#operations-Subscribed_Habits-list-subscribed-habits">/habits/subscribed/list/</a> endpoint.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Vitals</summary>
    <p>
        Similar to the Habits section, this section will describe the API endpoints for tracking a user's vitals. <br>
        This section is still in active development, but will resemble the Habit section closely.<br>
        There will be a section for the user to update the vitals they're willing to give (mostly focused on weight)
        and an endpoint that contains the historical logs of each time a user made an update, with the ability to go
        back and edit or remove certain data points, in instances where they fat-fingered the number, or made a mistake.
